Recline.js CSV Data View


A slightly updated codebase that leverages Recline.js to render a CSV file stored locally within the filesystem of the site.

Library updated to utilize Bootstrap 3.3.6, Material Design 0.5.9, Nanobar 0.4.2. This particular implementation renders a SlickGrid within a Recline.js multiView, with future plans to enable the Leaflet Map & Flot charting capabilities.

Sample data is located in data/ with two CSV files for testing.
